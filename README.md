As of Nov 2025, Discord will put long text pasted from clipboard into a txt file. 

In Discord's txt file viewer, it won't wrap long text, hence you have to scroll horizontally to see all the text, not ideal for RPs etc. 

The txt file viewer also only displays the first 50KB characters.

This tool manually inserts newlines to simulate word wrapping, and also provides text splitting/chunking functionality to solve the issues.
