As of Nov 2025, Discord will put long text pasted from clipboard into a message object. 

The thing is, Discord won't wrap long text in the message object's display client, hence you have to scroll horizontally to see all the text, not ideal for RPs etc. 

This tool manually inserts newlines to simulate word wrapping to solve the issue.
